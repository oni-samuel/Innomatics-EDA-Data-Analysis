# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Top 500 Companies

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the top 500 companies listed on Ambition Box. The dataset was gathered through web scraping using Python's Beautiful Soup library and further analyzed to uncover insights into company attributes such as ratings, reviews, locations, and more.

## Data Collection
The dataset was sourced from [Ambition Box](https://www.ambitionbox.com) by scraping the information using the following tools and libraries:

- **`requests`**: For making HTTP requests to fetch the webpage's HTML content.
- **`BeautifulSoup`**: For parsing the HTML and extracting the required information.
- **`re`**: For applying regular expressions to clean and structure the data.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: Process and structure the raw data into a meaningful format.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigate patterns, trends, and distributions in the data.
3. **Visualization**: Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots.
4. **Insights**: Derive actionable insights about the top 500 companies based on the available attributes.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data scraping and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical data visualization.

## Visualizations
Some of the visualizations included in this project are:

- **Bar Charts**: Company ratings comparison.
- **Pie Charts**: Proportion of companies across different locations.
- **Heatmaps**: Correlations between various metrics.

## Insights Derived
- Insights on company ratings and reviews.
- Analysis of company distribution across industries and locations.
- Identification of trends in the data that can inform decision-making.
